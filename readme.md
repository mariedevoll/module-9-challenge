# Module 9 Project

## Description
This project was created to generate a professional looking README file. The user is prompted with questions that will be imported into a template.

## Installation
To install the necessary applications, you first must download [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4). 

## Usage
To use the generator, you must open the integrated terminal within the index.js and type "npm init" and "npm install inquirer". A node_modules folder should appear. To put your information for the README file, you must type "node index.js" in the integrated terminal and the questions will pop up. At the end, a new README file will appear.

Attached is a video showing how to use integrated terminal:
