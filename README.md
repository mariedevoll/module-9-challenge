# Module 9 Challenge
This is my attempt at the module 9 challenge, which is desiginging a README file generator. I created a command-line application that generates a professional looking README file from the user's input using an inquirer package.

## Installation
To install this README generator, the user must copy the code from Github and also install the [inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) in the 8.2.4 version. By typing in "npm init" and hitting enter, then typing in "npm install requirer", the user should have the node files in their VSCode.

## Usage
Users should use the MIT license.

## Test
To test this program, users must open their integreated terminal within VSCode and initiate the creation by typing in "node index.js" and the questions should appear in the terminal. After the user has answered all of the questions, the responses will appear in a new README file.
